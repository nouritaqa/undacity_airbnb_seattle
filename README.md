## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in analyzing AirBnB data from 2016 to address the following questions:

1. Is there any seasonal variability in prices and room availability?
2. Which properties of the listing are associated with high price?
3. Can we predict the price with those properties to inform new hosts?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook(Seattle AirBnb Price Prediction.ipynb) available here to show the data preparation and analysis to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to describe the questions and findings of the data analysis.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@noritakahara/predicting-price-of-airbnb-in-seattle-for-2016-what-really-matters-8d52b221bb18).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

The data set for this project was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle).

For this project, I refer many codes to the excellent introductory book [Python for Data Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Data-Analysis-Wrangling-IPython-dp-1491957662/dp/1491957662/ref=dp_ob_title_bk)
